# odapt
odapt - a modular repository framework for tranforming data sources into objects and back again.

A java implementation of a high performance micro-ORM that supports:
* efficient, CRUD Repo operations in the Fluent style...
* that declares segregated metadata via annotated pojo's...
* populated via configurable, readily extensible data adapters and data transformation pipelines...
* and bridging the last mile using a unified interface for injected data access API's for supporting 3NF, NoSQL & stream based datastores...
* wrapped in an opinionated repository API.
